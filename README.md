# Mercantile

Mercantile helps you exchange items and services with others in your area! With an emphasis on reciprocity and mutual benefit, Mercantile is not an application for buying or selling items using currency. Instead, users are encouraged to barter whatever they would like to give for whatever they would like to get.

With Mercantile, you can...

* List an item for trade
* View items on offer
* View a "Wanted" board
* Make a trade offer
* Accept a trade offer

Mercantile uses Google Firebase for user authentication. Clicking Login in the Header tab will prompt you to sign in with your Google Account. When creating a listing, your name and email will be visible for other users to see and contact you. You will also be able to update and delete listings you specifically create. 

Mercantile also uses the Redline Zipcode API to show how far away items are, using the optional zipcode input users can add to their listing.
